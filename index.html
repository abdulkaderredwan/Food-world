                    <h3>Fruits & Vegetables</h3>
                    <p>Okay, okay, we admit that's not exactly breaking news, but did you know that when it comes to
                        rapid weight loss some veggies reign supreme while others fall fairly flat in comparison? It's
                        true!</p>

                    <h3>Spinach</h3>
                    <p>Popeye's favorite veggie is a great source of not only protein, but also vitamins A and C,
                        antioxidants and heart-healthy folate. One cup of the green superfood has nearly as much protein
                        as a hard-boiled eggâ€”for half the calories.</p>

                    <h3>Mustard Greens</h3>
                    <p>Another veggie worthy of a spot in your diet is mustard greens. When steamed, they provide a
                        whopping 922 percent of your RDI for vitamin K, 96 percent of your vitamin A, and 47 percent of
                        your vitamin C per cup.</p>
